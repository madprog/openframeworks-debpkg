libhubbub (0.3.4) stable; urgency=medium

  - Support falling back to space separated charset
       In some cases, for example, Apple Mail, programs generate HTML
       with apallingly bad meta tags such as:

           <meta content="text/html charset=utf-8">

       This is bad because *a* no http-equiv="Content-Type" and *b* because
       the content type and charset do not have a separating semi-colon.

       Sadly, Chrome et-al support this, so we need to in Hubbub.  This
       change adjusts the content="" parser to retry if it cannot find
       a semicolon, and work forwards to first whitespace instead.

       Fixes: #2549
